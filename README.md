# Module-4--Challenge

Following can be concluded after analyzing the data: 

1) Higher test grades were not always a direct result from a higher spending budget. 

2) Contrast to what we believe, schools who averaged a higher spending range per student ($645 to $675) averaged lower test results compared to a school who spent less per student. 

3) Charter schools outperformed district schools in both reading and math in percent passing grade. 

4)The results point that a student who attends a charter school is not only likely to pass both math and reading but will almost have 10 units higher than a student in a district school.
